## Context

Project requires creation of interactive visualization of robotics simulation in real time (60 FPS). The app will intensely use WebGL (React Three Fiber) and WebSockets. Frontend is a light client, the business logic is inside backed services (Rust/Go).

## Decision

I choose Vite (SPA) over Next.js (SRR)

## Justification

### No need for SRR

Simulation is entirely rendered on the client's side (Canvas).

### Dev efficiency

Vite offers a much faster HMR (Hot Module Replacement - the website doesn't refresh after code change), which is crucial with frequent scene refreshment

### Clear architecture

No second backend (In Next.js it would be API Routes). Go Gateway is the single source of truth.

## Consequences

### Client routing

Using React Router, defining "URL - component" map

### No native image optimization
